The scripts are:
figure1_through_4plotting.m - necesssary to produce figures 1 through 4 and associated supplemental figures
In the folder "f5_atac" is the data and code necessary to produce the ATAC portion of figure 5
In the folder "figure6_RNAseq" is the data and code necessary to produce figure 6
The python script "DL_tiny_combined3-1.py" contains the code neccessary to reproduce the ML model in figure 7

All data are called in the appropriate scripts
